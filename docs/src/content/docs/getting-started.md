title: Getting Started
---

Get started by **spinning up a did-web-server**.

Either **create a new for the server's owner** or **use one of your existing
DID**. The following DID methods are supported: did:key, did:jwk, and did:web.
Then, start your server.

## Create a DID

The first step in setting up did-web-server is to create the DID for the
server's owner. Multiple ways exist to do that. The excellent
[DIDKit](https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit/installation) CLI can be used to
do that.

1. Generate a key:

```bash title="owner.jwk"
docker run -it --rm -u "$(id -u):(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/app" -w "/app" ghcr.io/spruceid/didkit-cli:latest key generate ed25519 > owner.jwk
```

2. Derive a did:key DID:

```bash title="owner.did"
docker run -it --rm -u "$(id -u):(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/app" -w "/app" ghcr.io/spruceid/didkit-cli:latest key-to-did -k owner.jwk > owner.did
```

## Start your server

Prepare to start a local test server via Docker that serves DIDs on your
computer and stores them on the local file system. The first step is to
configure did-web-server via environment variables. Create a configuration file
called `.env` with the following contents:

```bash title=".env"
DID_WEB_SERVER_OWNER=did:key:xxxx # Put the created or existing DID here.
DID_WEB_SERVER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME=id.localhost # Hostname and port determine the DIDs that are managed by this server, e.g. did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:xyz.
DID_WEB_SERVER_EXTERNAL_PORT=3000 # Set DID_WEB_SERVER_PORT and DID_WEB_SERVER_EXTERNAL_PORT to the same value for this test.
DID_WEB_SERVER_PORT=3000 # Set DID_WEB_SERVER_PORT and DID_WEB_SERVER_EXTERNAL_PORT to the same value for this test.
DID_WEB_SERVER_BACKEND=file # Store DIDs on the local file system.
DID_WEB_SERVER_BACKEND_FILE_STORE=/server/dids # DIDs will be stored in the `dids` folder below your current directory.
# DID_WEB_SERVER_TLS=/server/cert.pem # For compatibilty with DID resolvers, a certificate is required. It will be added later.
```

The `id.localhost` hostname (variable `DID_WEB_SERVER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME`) works
on every operating system without additional configuration. However, it is only
accessible by the local computer. Other systems will not be able to resolve DIDs
on this server. For testing purposes on your computer, this configuration is
fully sufficient.

With the configuration in place, it is time to start the server. Execute the
following command to start the server in the current directory. Newly created
DIDs will be stored in the `./dids` directory:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000 --env-file .env -u "$(id -u):(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/server" -w "/server" registry.41ppl.com/did-web-server:latest
```

## Create the first local DID

Congratulations, the server is up and running! It does not contain any DID, yet.
Let's create the first DID: `did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:person1`

### Create key

Every DID requires a public private key pair. We can reuse the previous command
to create another key pair for the new DID:

```bash title="person1.jwk"
docker run -it --rm -u "$(id -u):(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/app" -w "/app" ghcr.io/spruceid/didkit-cli:latest key generate ed25519 > person1.jwk
```

### Create DID document

Execute the following command to create the DID document that includes the
generated public key:

```bash title="person1-did.json"
cat > person1-did.json <<EOF
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:person1",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "@context": {
        "sec": "https://w3id.org/security/v2#",
        "jwk2020": "https://w3c.github.io/vc-jws-2020/contexts/v1#"
      },
      "id": "did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:person1#key1",
      "type": "did:Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
      "sec:controller": "did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:person1",
      "jwk2020:publicKeyJwk": {
        "jwk2020:kty": "OKP",
        "jwk2020:crv": "Ed25519",
        "jwk2020:x": "$(jq -r .x person1.jwk)"
      }
    }
  ],
  "authentication": ["did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:person1#key1"],
  "assertionMethod": ["did:web:id.localhost%3A3000:person1#key1"]
}
EOF
```

### Place DID document in Verifiable Credential

Since did-web-server uses Verifiable Credentials for authentication and
authorization, and DID documents as data, the created DID document needs to be
placed within a Verifiable Credential. Execute the following command to create
and sign the credential:

:::note

The credential must be issued by the server's owner, because only the owner has
the right to create DIDs on this server. In contrast, updates are performed by
the controller of the DID and not by the server's owner.

:::

```bash title="person1-vc-did.json"
cat > person1-vc-did.json <<EOF
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "id": "uuid:49387f58-c0d9-4b14-a4f4-bc31a021d925",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "$(cat owner.did)",
  "issuanceDate": "$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "credentialSubject": $(cat person1-did.json)
}
EOF
```

Sign credential:

```bash title="person1-vc-did-signed.json"
didkit vc-issue-credential -k owner.jwk -p assertionMethod -t Ed25519Signature2018 -v "$(cat owner.did)" < person1-vc-did.json > person1-vc-did-signed.json
```

### Place Verifiable Credential in Verifiable Presentation

The last step in preparing the data for submission is to place the signed
Verifiable Credential within a Verifiable Presentation and secure the
registration against replay attacks. did-web-server prevents reply attacks i.e.
the observation and resubmission of a valid presentation with the goal of
overwriting the current configuration of the DID, by expecting the hash of the
current DID document to be present as a
[challenge](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#proofs) in the proof
section of the Verifiable Presentation, alongside other parameters.

The first step of placing the Verifiable Credential inside a Verifiable
Presentation is to retrieve the proof parameters for the DID:

```bash title="person1-vp-proof-parameters.json"
curl -f -o person1-vp-proof-parameters.json http://id.localhost:3000/person1/did.json?proofParameters
```

:::note

The proof parameters will be the same on all systems that use the same DNS name,
i.e. `id.localhost`! This is by design. The did:web method relies on a secure
DNS configuration!

:::

With the proof parameters in place, the next steps are to create the
presentation:

```bash title="person1-vp.json"
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  "holder": "$(cat owner.did)",
  "verifiableCredential": $(cat person1-vc-did-signed.json)
}
```

Finally, sign the presentation with the correct proof parameters:

```bash title="person1-vc-did-signed.json"
didkit vc-issue-presentation -k owner.jwk -p assertionMethod -t Ed25519Signature2018 -v "$(cat owner.did)" < person1-vp.json > person1-vp-signed.json
```

### Register DID on server

The last step is to submit the signed presentation to the server:

```bash
curl -f -X POST -d @person1-vp-signed.json http://id.localhost:3000/person1/did.json
```

The DID document can now be retrieved from did-web-server for inspection:

```bash
curl -f http://id.localhost:3000/person1/did.json
```

Congratulations, you've registered the first DID! ðŸŽ‰ To make the server fully
operational, a TLS certificate is required. The steps for adding a valid TLS
certificate to this server are described in the
[deployment guide for a local test server](/deployment/test-server)
